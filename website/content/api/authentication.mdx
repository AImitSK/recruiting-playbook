description: Learn how to authenticate with the Recruiting Playbook REST API using WordPress Application Passwords or dedicated API keys.
---

## Base URL

All API endpoints are available under:

```bash
https://your-site.com/wp-json/recruiting/v1/
```

## Option 1: WordPress Application Passwords

Since WordPress 5.6, Application Passwords are built in. This is the simplest way to authenticate.

Navigate to **Users → Profile → Application Passwords** in your WordPress admin to generate a password.

```bash
curl -X GET \
  https://your-site.com/wp-json/recruiting/v1/jobs \
  -u "username:xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx"
```

Application Passwords use HTTP Basic Auth. The password is space-separated and provided when created.

## Option 2: API Key (Pro)

Pro users can generate dedicated API keys in the plugin settings. Keys offer granular permission control and are ideal for server-to-server integrations.

### Header-based authentication

```bash
curl -X GET \
  https://your-site.com/wp-json/recruiting/v1/jobs \
  -H "X-Recruiting-API-Key: rp_live_abc123..."
```

### Query parameter authentication

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "https://your-site.com/wp-json/recruiting/v1/jobs?api_key=rp_live_abc123..."
```

Header-based authentication is recommended for production use. Query parameters may be logged by proxies and web servers.

## API Key Management (Pro)

Generate and manage API keys under **Plugin Settings → API** in the WordPress admin.

Each API key supports fine-grained permissions:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Read Jobs | List and retrieve job listings |
| Write Jobs | Create, update, and delete jobs |
| Read Applications | List and retrieve applications |
| Write Applications | Update status, add notes, manage ratings |
| Settings | Access plugin configuration |

### Key prefixes

| Prefix | Environment |
|--------|-------------|
| `rp_live_` | Production key |
| `rp_test_` | Test/staging key |

Test keys work identically to live keys but are visually distinguished in the admin UI for easier management.

## Required Permissions

Different endpoints require different permission levels:

| Endpoint | Required Permission |
|----------|-------------------|
| `GET /jobs` | Read Jobs |
| `POST /jobs` | Write Jobs |
| `GET /applications` | Read Applications |
| `PUT /applications/{id}/status` | Write Applications |
| `POST /webhooks` | Settings |
| `GET /reports/*` | Read Applications |

Requests without sufficient permissions return a `403 Forbidden` response.
